## What you have learnt from this chapter

This chapter has given you a taster for R: you’ve learnt about the user interface, writing scripts, commenting scripts and creating barplots. And if you completed the challenge, you have managed to modify the arguments of the barplot to create some fantastically ugly plots.

## Our courses

If you would like to learn more R or just really want to learn more about survival of Titanic passengers, we offer [free 2-day introductory R courses](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/participate). By the end of the two days you will have had experience reading in, manipulating and visualising data using R.

## Self-directed learning

 If you would like to continue with some self-directed learning, there are many online courses available, such as:
* [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/)
* [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-094-introduction-to-matlab-january-iap-2010/)
* [Coursera Data Science Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

Hadley Wickham's book [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) also provides a good starting point for learning R.

## Where to find help

When you start coding (and even when you are an experienced coder), [Google](www.google.com.au) is your friend. Google searches will often direct you to a website called [stackoverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) where people post and answer programming-related questions.

## Don't be afraid to make mistakes

Learning to program is a lot about making mistakes. It’s great for someone to warn you about something, but you won't truly understand until you make the mistake yourself. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes!
